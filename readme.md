## Keyboard

I make some keyboard mods using Karabiner Elements.

- "Change caps_lock to left_control if pressed with other keys, change caps_lock to escape if pressed alone."
- "Change right_command+hjkl to arrow keys"

```bash
brew install karabiner-elements
```

## Mac Fixes

Remember to disable the following settings so that `C-space` keyboard shortcuts work.
