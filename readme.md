## Keymaps

To make the keyboard much more pleasant to use install Karabiner Elements;

```bash
brew install karabiner-elements
```

And then make sure the following are configured;

- "Change caps_lock to left_control if pressed with other keys, change caps_lock to escape if pressed alone."

  You will need to import this from the website via the "Complex Modifications" section.

- "Change right_command+hjkl to arrow keys"

  This is by default bundles with Karabiner, you can add the rule via the "Complex Modifications" section.
