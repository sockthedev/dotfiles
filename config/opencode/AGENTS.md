# Global Agent Rules

These are global rules that you MUST always adhere to.

- You MUST ONLY add comments if the code you are creating is complex.
- You MUST ALWAYS perform a deeper research to find existing patterns or integrations of a code against other modules.
- You MUST ALWAYS prefer a clean and simple functional coding approach.
- You MUST ALWAYS consider if there is a better approach to a solution compared to the one being asked by the user. Feel free to challenge the user and make suggestions.
